When I am writing a paper\
I mean when I really want to write a paper\
I am not enjoying it\
Far from that\
I feel like owning something to the world\
A debt\
This urge drives me to get up early\
Sleep late\
Barely standing up\
Just write, think, prove\
To spit out\
Because it feels\
Necessary\
Once it is done\
Only blankly emptiness is around me\
I need to throw myself into a corner\
For days\
Weeks\
To feel be alive again
