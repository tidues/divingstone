Some\
Thing \
Wanna be breaking out\
The dying bitch is tearing my head\
Try real hard\
Every millisecond\
Harder\
Pretending to perceive\
A normalcy\
Yet the shit born with me is invading\
Permeating pores\
Hacking bones\
Cannot shake off an enormous shadow\
Bang bang baaang\
Bangbanbanbanbang\
Five fleeting\
None alive\
Keep the sun shining\
Me mellow\
Mutated ants\
Chewing a blackhole\
You said love me once\
Then killed my soul\
A walking monkey\
Flying low\
Tieing the knots\
Making a sense\
Lorentz fucked the sole balance\
Drilling eyes\
Squashing the noise\
A peace followed\
By a silence\
Last for centuries\
Till, some\
Thing\
Wanna be breaking out
