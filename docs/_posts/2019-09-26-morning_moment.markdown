See my molecules\
they are popping, colliding, disappearing\
they are unmethodical, unpredictable, indeterminable\
at the time when I'm chilling\
sitting back\
holding a warm tea

I to my cells is like\
the universe to humanity

So, happy the sad\
believe the contradiction\
wrong right\
shout to empty\
be crazy, be silly\
When knowing that\
they are as significant to me\
as insignificant to the entirety
